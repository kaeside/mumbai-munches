//TODO: Offer the kitchen staff constant access to a list of active orders, and the ingredients in them.

//TODO: Once per day, allow the ingredient buyers to find the ingredients that are low on stock.

//TODO: The counter staff must see the total price of an order when an order is placed.

//TODO: Generate a monthly report, for the marketing experts, about which ingredients are the most popular.

//TODO: Once every six months, the pricing team updates the ingredient prices (to maximize those profits!)
